# Setup for Mac Users
---
0. Download and install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html).
0. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  
	*  Anaconda is free. You don't have to create an account, but you do need to provide a valid email. 
	* Once you submit your email, you will be sent to another page where you pick which type of computer you have.  (Mac users make sure you [know what chip  you have](https://www.howtogeek.com/706226/how-to-check-if-your-mac-is-using-an-intel-or-apple-silicon-processor/) and choose the appropriate version for that chip.  Always choose the Graphical Installer version because it is easier. 
	* Download the Graphical Installer, and then install it like any normal application. 

0. Update [git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
	* If you are getting a `homebrew` error you need to install homebrew. You can do so easily here [install homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

0. OPTIONAL: Download and install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and/or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
